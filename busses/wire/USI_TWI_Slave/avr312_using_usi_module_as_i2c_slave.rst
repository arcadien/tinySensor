AVR312: Using the USI module as a I2C slave on tinyAVR and megaAVR devices
==========================================================================

This application note provides code examples to use the USI module on AVR devices as a I2C slave. Most of the tinyAVR and megaAVR devices have USI module which can perform both I2C slave and
I2C master.

For a more detailed description, please see the applicaiton note available from: http://www.atmel.com/images/atmel-2560-using-the-usi-module-as-a-i2c-slave_applicationnote_avr312.pdf
